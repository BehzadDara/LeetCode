## Zigzag Conversion

### Problem Description

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

### Example 1:

Input: `s = "PAYPALISHIRING"`, `numRows = 4`  
Output: `"PINALSIGYAHRPI"`

### Example 2:

Input: `s = "A"`, `numRows = 1`  
Output: `"A"`

### Solution

The solution converts the input string `s` into a zigzag pattern with the specified number of rows, then reads the zigzag row by row to construct the final string. The approach involves iterating through the string and placing characters in the appropriate rows, alternating between moving down the rows and up the rows.
